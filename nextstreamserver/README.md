# Portfolio event app for online users

This app is designe to run on Google Cloud, but because its to expensive to run node just for portfolio presentation purpose, it is running on single server.
Need to change code where TODO says its for cloud environment, also needs to change four x to destination url where needed.

## Mails sending functionality is disable because of portfolio public access allows abuse of email
